title: Installing on Windows
--- 

## Prerequisites:
- Windows 10 or Higher
- Virtualization capabilities
- 8GB of RAM or more

## Step 1 (Installing WSL2)
Install WSL2. If you have WSL2 already, you can skip this step.
Open Powershell as an administrator and run this command
```
wsl --install
```
It will prompt a reboot, reboot and let it install Ubuntu. One that is done, make a username and password. It does not have to be the same as the system.

If you do not see the window for Ubuntu

## Step 2 (Getting the files)
Open a new Ubuntu terminal window, and run this command, replacing the WINDOWS_USER_NAME with the your Windows username, not the Linux one.
```
cd /mnt/c/users/WINDOWS_USER_NAME/Documents
```
Then run
```
sudo apt install git-all -y
```
Now clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/notAperson535/OneClick-macOS-Simple-KVM.git
```
Now cd into the newly created folder
```
cd OneClick-macOS-Simple-KVM
```

## Step 3 (installing qemu and virtualization capabilities)
Run the included windows installer
```
./windows-install.sh
```
Once you get to the menu (looks like this)

Go to Virtualization and make sure your system processor type is selected, mine is Intel

Then keep clicking exit, and save the configuration

Now run these commands to make sure virtualization works
```
kvm-ok
cat /sys/module/kvm_intel/parameters/nested
```
If the first command returns `KVM acceleration can be used` and the second command returns `Y`, then you are good to go. If the first command returns `Y` but the second command return something like `no`, then go to the bottom of the page for troubleshooting.

Now make sure you are still in the OneClick-macOS-Simple-KVM directory, the path should look something like this:
```
/mnt/c/users/WINDOWS_USER_NAME/Documents/OneClick-macOS-Simple-KVM
```
Next run `./setup.sh` to finish the setup and run the macOS VM!

Once setup.sh finsishes and you see a QEMU window pop up, press ctrl+c and run `sudo HEADLESS=1 ./basic.sh`. Once this is done, download VNC Viewer, [here](https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/), then type `localhost:5900` into the top to connect to the vm using vnc.

Whenever you want to load up the machine again, run `sudo HEADLESS=1 ./basic.sh`, NOT `./setup.sh`.

## You're done!

Don't close the terminal when the QEMU window is open, as it will shut down the VM and may cause data loss.

## [Now head over to installing macOS for instructions on correctly installing macOS](https://notaperson535.github.io/OneClick-macOS-Simple-KVM/docs/installing-macos/)

## Troubleshooting

### cat /sys/module/kvm_intel/parameters/nested returns `N`, but KVM-OK Returns `KVM acceleration can be used`

Edit these commands in .wslconfig, which is located in your Windows user directory, replacing the WINDOWS_USER_NAME with the your Windows username, not the Linux one.
```
nestedVirtualization=true
kernel=C:\\Users\\WINDOWS_USER_NAME\\bzImage
debugConsole=true
pageReporting=true
kernelCommandLine=intel_iommu=on iommu=pt kvm.ignore_msrs=1 kvm-intel.nested=1 kvm-intel.ept=1 kvm-intel.emulate_invalid_guest_state=0 kvm-intel.enable_shadow_vmcs=1 kvm-intel.enable_apicv=1
```

### Getting `Your CPU does not support KVM extensions` on AMD processors

For those with AMD EPYC/Ryzen processor or later, Nested Virtualization (required for KVM) [is not supported on Windows 10](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/user-guide/enable-nested-virtualization#amd-epyc--ryzen-processor-or-later). So you have to upgrade to Windows 11.
