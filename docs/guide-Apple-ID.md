1. Use a random multicast [MAC address generator](https://www.hellion.org.uk/cgi-bin/randmac.pl) and paste it into the template generated by `make.sh`. 
 - While I was editing the template, I also used `uuidgen` and pasted that in there for good measure.
 - Then import the template with `virsh define whatever.xml`.
2. Inside macOS, download [Clover Configurator](https://mackie100projects.altervista.org/download-clover-configurator/) and use it to mount the EFI partition, then close it.
3. Download [GenSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS) and gernerate a set of serials for the mac model shown under "System Report", for example "iMacPro1,1".
4. Locate the plist file at /Volumes/EFI/OC/config.plist . Insert the generated serials into the apropiate places in that file. You can edit it by hand or use [ProperTree](https://github.com/corpnewt/ProperTree) for this.
5. Reboot. You should be able to log in with your Apple-ID now.
