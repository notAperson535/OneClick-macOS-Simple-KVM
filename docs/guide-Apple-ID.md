title: Apple-ID fixing

[Video guide here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBRrCYZEjtI) (Use SMBIOS iMacPro1,1)

1. Modify the MAC address. You can use a random multicast [MAC address generator](https://www.hellion.org.uk/cgi-bin/randmac.pl).
    - With the `basic.sh` script, just edit the script and modify the MAC address (search for "mac=").
    - With virt-manager, paste it into the template generated by `make.sh`. While I was editing the template, I also used `uuidgen` and pasted that in there for good measure. Then import the template with `virsh define whatever.xml`.

2. In the macOS Finder, look for **EFI** in the left bar under **Volumes**. If it isn't visible you will have to mount it:
    - Open the macOS Terminal and type `diskutil list` and look for the disk/partition location of the EFI. (There may be more than one.)
    - Type `sudo diskutil mount diskYsZ`, using the disk/partition location name where you see EFI. It should look like this:

3. Download [GenSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS) and generate a set of serials for the mac model shown under "System Report" ("iMacPro1,1").
4. Locate the plist file at `/Volumes/EFI/OC/config.plist`. Insert the generated serials into generic section in the appropriate places.

| GenSMBIOS Value | config.plist       |
| --------------- | ------------------ | 
| Type            | SystemProductName  | 
| Serial          | SystemSerialNumber |
| Board Serial    | MLB                |
| SmUUID          | SystemUUID         |

5. You can edit it by hand or use [ProperTree](https://github.com/corpnewt/ProperTree) for this.
6. Reboot.
    - *Sequoia only*: In this version, it seems macOS detects the VM and "blocks" the apple ID. To trick macOS the default opencore config disables the flag "hv_vmm_present" (WILL BE IMPLEMENTED SOON *written on 12/12/2024*).
    - Due to this, make sure the flag `hv_vmm_present` set to 0 by runnning the command `sysctl kern | grep 'kern.hv_vmm_present'`. If it is not, try [updating your local repo](/docs/start-here#important), and if this still does not work, open an issue or join the [discord server](https://discord.gg/XaEdCSPyNa).
7. You should be able to log in with your Apple ID now.
